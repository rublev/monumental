I want you to work with me on a PRD.txt for task-master-ai to process into tasks. I was given a job description in @REQUIREMENTS.md. This is quite complex however, and I've done a bunch of research on it, so I would rather make the initial PRD myself and eventually transition into fulfilling this job assignment document.

Instead, I want to do the following:

I need you to scaffold a basic frontend, and a basic backend. At a high level, for the frontend, I want to use vue3 with typescript. For the backend, I want to use uWebSockets.js.

On the frontend:

- vue3 + TresJS for vue+threejs integration
- tailwind v4.1
- shadcn for components

backend:

- simple uWebSockets backend server

In terms of functionality, I just want a basic websocket connection transmitting between the backend and the frontend. Simplicity and readability for me are key rather than overly clever or overly complex solutions.

Separately, render a basic threejs scene. I want to see a basic threejs scene and socket connected in console.
