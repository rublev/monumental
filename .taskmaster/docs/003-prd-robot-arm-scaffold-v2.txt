There is an example repository in @CRANE-EXAMPLE/. It is a crane with a bunch of balls on the ground and a cup. you can click on a ball and it will pick it up with pincers and drop it in the cup.

The difference between this example repo and mine is that our crane structure is different. we have a lift, and then an arm with an elbow, and then another arm with a wrist, and then a gripper.

I want you to look at this CRANE-EXAMPLE repository and implement the same inverse kinematics (not the ball pickup/drop) so that I can input x/y/z coordinates or click in 3d space and have the crane. The CRANE-EXAMPLE is using two npm libraries: kinematics, and three.interaction (for the ball interaction, which right now we don't care about). My problem is I am unsure if this kinematics library works for our purpose, or only for this examples specific crane build. Use context7 when learning about these libraries.
