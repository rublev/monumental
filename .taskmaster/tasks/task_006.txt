# Task ID: 6
# Title: Static Frontend Crane Visualization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a simple static 3D visualization of the crane using vanilla Three.js, including a circular base, rectangular rotating column, and lift block inside the column.
# Details:
Create CraneVisualization.vue component in components directory using <script setup lang="ts"> syntax. Import necessary Three.js types and TresJS components from @tresjs/core. Build crane geometry using: 1) Circular base - TresMesh with TresCylinderGeometry args=[baseRadius, baseRadius, baseHeight, 32] and TresMeshStandardMaterial with appropriate color. 2) Rectangular hollow column - Create outer TresBoxGeometry for column structure and inner geometry to create hollow effect, position above base. 3) Lift block - Small TresBoxGeometry positioned inside the column interior. Use TresGroup to organize crane components hierarchically. Set up appropriate lighting with TresAmbientLight and TresDirectionalLight. Position TresPerspectiveCamera to show full crane structure. Use ref() for component references and ensure proper TypeScript typing throughout. Focus on simple static geometry without physics or animations - purely for visual testing and reference.

# Test Strategy:
Verify CraneVisualization.vue component renders without WebGL errors. Check that circular base appears as expected cylinder geometry. Confirm rectangular column is visible with hollow interior space. Validate lift block is positioned correctly inside column. Test component integration by importing into main Vue app and verifying crane structure matches reference images. Ensure proper TypeScript compilation with no type errors. Test camera positioning shows complete crane structure clearly. Verify lighting illuminates all crane components appropriately.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create CraneVisualization component file [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the main Vue component file for the crane visualization with basic structure and imports
### Details:
Create CraneVisualization.vue component with script setup, template, and style sections. Import Three.js dependencies and set up basic component structure with refs for canvas and scene objects.

## 2. Set up Three.js scene initialization [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Initialize Three.js scene, camera, renderer, and lighting for the crane visualization
### Details:
Set up WebGL renderer, perspective camera with appropriate positioning, scene object, ambient and directional lighting. Configure renderer settings for proper display and add canvas to DOM.

## 3. Add circular base geometry [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Create and add the circular base geometry for the crane foundation
### Details:
Create a cylinder geometry for the crane base with appropriate dimensions. Apply material and positioning. Add the base mesh to the scene with proper scaling and positioning at ground level.

## 4. Add rectangular column geometry [done]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Create and add the vertical rectangular column geometry for the crane mast
### Details:
Create a box geometry for the crane's vertical column/mast. Position it correctly on top of the base, apply appropriate materials and dimensions to create a realistic crane column appearance.

## 5. Add lift block inside column [done]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Create and position the lift block geometry inside the crane column
### Details:
Create a smaller box geometry representing the lift block/elevator car. Position it inside the column structure with appropriate materials and sizing. Ensure proper visibility and positioning within the column bounds.

## 6. Add remaining crane components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add the horizontal arm attached to lift block, elbow joint, wrist joint, wrist extension, and gripper components to complete the crane visualization
### Details:
Add the remaining crane parts: 1) Horizontal arm extending from the lift block through the open front face, 2) Elbow joint in the middle of the arm for rotation, 3) Lower arm section after elbow, 4) Wrist joint at end of lower arm, 5) Wrist extension (fixed piece extending downward), 6) Gripper with fixed and movable jaws. Use lattice structure for the arm sections similar to the tower. Position joints as cylinders/pivots. Make gripper jaws as simple rectangular pieces.
