# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Inverse Kinematics for Crane Arm using Kinematics Library
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement inverse kinematics for the complete crane structure using Three.js CCDIKSolver instead of the kinematics library, converting the crane to a bone/skeleton system while maintaining visual meshes, and enabling x/y/z coordinate input or 3D click interactions to control the crane position through its 6-DOF kinematic chain.
# Details:
1. Convert crane from mesh/group hierarchy to bone/skeleton system while keeping visual meshes: Create skeleton with bones for Base (rotation), Lift (translation), Arm1, Arm2, Vertical column, and Gripper. Attach existing visual meshes as non-skinned children of bones to maintain appearance. 2. Set up CCDIKSolver with proper IK chains and joint constraints: Configure Base for Y-axis rotation only, set up rotation constraints for Arms, and handle Lift Y-axis translation separately since CCDIKSolver only handles rotations. 3. Implement custom logic for lift height based on target position: Solve lift position before applying rotational IK since CCDIKSolver cannot handle translational joints. 4. Add interaction system with click-to-position and coordinate input interface to test the complete IK system. 5. Connect bone movements to visual meshes and handle unreachable positions appropriately. The implementation should be frontend-only within CraneVisualization.vue component using Three.js CCDIKSolver.

# Test Strategy:
Test by: 1. Verifying successful conversion from mesh hierarchy to bone/skeleton system while maintaining visual appearance. 2. Confirming CCDIKSolver setup with proper joint constraints (base Y-rotation, arm rotations, lift translation handling). 3. Testing that bone movements correctly drive visual mesh positions in the 3D scene. 4. Validating inverse kinematics calculations reach target coordinates accurately through the complete kinematic chain using CCDIKSolver. 5. Testing coordinate input or click interactions move the crane to expected positions with proper joint coordination. 6. Checking custom lift height logic works correctly in combination with rotational IK. 7. Verifying unreachable positions are handled gracefully without breaking the solver. 8. Testing smooth motion coordination between all 6 degrees of freedom.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Convert crane mesh hierarchy to bone/skeleton system [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Transform the existing Three.js mesh/group hierarchy into a bone-based skeleton while preserving visual meshes
### Details:
Create Three.js Skeleton with bones for: Base (Y-axis rotation), Lift (Y-axis translation), Arm1 (rotation at shoulder), Arm2 (rotation at elbow), Vertical column (rotation at wrist), and Gripper (end effector). Attach existing visual meshes as non-skinned children of their corresponding bones to maintain visual appearance while enabling bone-driven movement.

## 2. Set up CCDIKSolver with joint constraints [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure Three.js CCDIKSolver with proper IK chains and joint constraints for the crane structure
### Details:
Import and configure CCDIKSolver from Three.js. Set up IK chains for the rotational joints (Base, Arm1, Arm2, Vertical column). Configure joint constraints: Base limited to Y-axis rotation only, Arms with appropriate rotation limits to prevent unrealistic poses. Note that Lift translation will be handled separately as CCDIKSolver only processes rotational joints.

## 3. Implement custom lift height logic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create custom logic to handle lift Y-axis translation separately from CCDIKSolver
### Details:
Since CCDIKSolver only handles rotations, implement separate logic for lift height calculation. Analyze target position to determine required lift height, then solve lift position before applying rotational IK to remaining joints. Ensure lift movement is coordinated with the rotational IK solution.

The lift height calculation is the first step in the IK solving process. The approach is: 1) Calculate the vertical offset from the gripper's underside to the lift's top face (this is a fixed distance based on the arm geometry). 2) When given a target XYZ position, first calculate the required lift height by subtracting this offset from the target Y coordinate. 3) Move the lift to this calculated height. 4) Then apply CCDIKSolver for the rotational joints to reach the XY position at the correct height. This ensures the lift is at the correct height before the rotational IK tries to reach the target position.

## 4. Add interaction system for coordinate input and click positioning [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement user interface for testing IK system with coordinate input and 3D click interactions
### Details:
Create input controls for manual X/Y/Z coordinate entry. Implement 3D click interaction system using Three.js raycasting to detect clicked positions in 3D space. Connect both input methods to trigger IK calculations and crane movement to target positions.

## 5. Connect bone movements to visual meshes and handle edge cases [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure bone movements properly drive visual mesh positions and handle unreachable positions gracefully
### Details:
Verify that bone transformations correctly update visual mesh positions and orientations. Implement error handling for unreachable positions that return NaN or invalid solutions. Add visual feedback for successful vs. failed IK attempts.

## 6. Add control panel with XYZ sliders for target manipulation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a control panel with sliders to manipulate target position in 3D space, replacing the click-based interaction
### Details:
Add a control panel similar to the CCDIKSolver Demo with X, Y, Z sliders to control the target position. This provides more precise control than clicking in 3D space. Include range limits based on crane's reach and a reset button to return to default position.

## 7. Fix base rotation to only allow Y-axis (yaw) movement [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Restrict the base bone to only rotate around the Y-axis, preventing unwanted roll and pitch movements
### Details:
Currently the base bone rotates in all axes like a buoy, which is incorrect. The base, yellow crane column, and crane column cap should all be part of one bone that only rotates around the Y-axis (yaw). This requires: 1) Properly configuring the IK chain constraints to restrict base rotation to Y-axis only, 2) Ensuring the constraint is actually being applied by CCDIKSolver, 3) Potentially modifying the bone setup if the constraint system isn't working as expected. The base should act like a turntable - only spinning horizontally, never tilting.

## 8. Simplify base rotation constraints [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove the overcomplicated constraint enforcement code and implement the simplest solution that works - just reset X and Z rotations to 0 after IK solver update
### Details:


## 9. Fix shoulder bone to be rigid with lift [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: The shoulder bone (first arm attachment) should not rotate independently. It should be rigidly attached to the lift face, moving only when the lift moves. The arm and lift should act as one entity.
### Details:


## 10. Constrain vertical arm to Y-axis rotation only [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: The vertical arm (wrist bone) should only be able to rotate/yaw around the Y-axis, similar to the base. It should not be able to tilt or roll.
### Details:


## 11. Remove rotation limits on second arm [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: The second arm (elbow bone) should have no rotation limits and be able to rotate a full 360 degrees
### Details:


## 12. Fix second arm rotation for close targets [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: The second arm (elbow bone) is not rotating correctly to reach targets close to the crane column. When the target is near the base, the second arm should be able to rotate/fold back towards the crane to bring the gripper to the target position, but currently it's not finding this configuration.
