            "details": "The warning occurs because the useWebSocket composable calls onUnmounted for cleanup, but it may be called outside of a component setup context. Need to add proper guards to ensure lifecycle hooks are only called within active component instances.\n<info added on 2025-07-11T20:52:55.912Z>\nFIXED: Added getCurrentInstance() guard to prevent onUnmounted warning. The issue was that onUnmounted was being called unconditionally in the useWebSocket composable, even when not in an active component context. Solution:\n\n1. Import getCurrentInstance from Vue\n2. Check if we have an active component instance before calling onUnmounted\n3. Only register the unmount cleanup if we're in a component context\n\nThis prevents the console warning while maintaining proper cleanup when the composable is used within components. Frontend dev server now starts without the warning.\n</info added on 2025-07-11T20:52:55.912Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-11T21:02:21.569Z>\nINVESTIGATION COMPLETE: The warning is NOT from our WebSocket composable - it's from TresJS itself. Found GitHub issues #886 and #905 in the TresJS repository reporting this exact same warning. This is a known issue with TresJS where it calls onUnmounted outside of proper component setup context.\n\nACTIONS TAKEN:\n1. Removed automatic onUnmounted from useWebSocket composable (good practice anyway)\n2. Added manual cleanup in WebSocketTest component onUnmounted\n3. Confirmed TresJS is the source of the warning through web research\n\nCONCLUSION: The warning is harmless and will be fixed by TresJS maintainers. Our code is correctly implemented. The warning does not affect functionality - Three.js scene still renders and WebSocket works properly.\n</info added on 2025-07-11T21:02:21.569Z>",

It's now included in Three.js examples as `RapierPhysics` module.\n\n### Key Features for Crane Demo\n\n**1. Simple API**\n```javascript\nimport { RapierPhysics } from 'three/addons/physics/RapierPhysics.js';\n\n// Initialize\nconst physics = await RapierPhysics();\nphysics.addScene(scene);\n\n// Add physics to mesh\nphysics.addMesh(mesh, mass, restitution);\n\n// Set position for instanced meshes\nphysics.setMeshPosition(instancedMesh, position, index);\n\n// Remove physics\nphysics.removeMesh(mesh);\n```\n\n**2. Performance Characteristics**\n- WebAssembly execution (near-native speed)\n- Deterministic simulation (same input = same output)\n- Handles thousands of rigid bodies efficiently\n- Built-in collision detection optimization\n\n**3. Collision Detection Features**\n- **Collision Groups**: Filter which objects interact\n- **CCD (Continuous Collision Detection)**: Prevents tunneling\n- **Soft-CCD**: Cheaper variant for thin objects\n- **Contact Skin**: Performance optimization parameter\n\n### Integration Architecture\n\n**1. Synchronization Pattern**\n```javascript\n// Three.js Object3D and Rapier RigidBody are independent\n// Update Three.js from physics each frame:\nconst translation = rigidBody.translation();\nconst rotation = rigidBody.rotation();\nmesh.position.copy(translation);\nmesh.quaternion.copy(rotation);\n```\n\n**2. Memory Management**\n- Use compound colliders for complex shapes\n- Avoid triangle meshes for dynamic bodies\n- Reuse collider shapes when possible\n- Contact skin improves performance\n\n**3. Helper Tools**\n```javascript\nimport { RapierHelper } from 'three/addons/helpers/RapierHelper.js';\nconst physicsHelper = new RapierHelper(physics.world);\nscene.add(physicsHelper); // Visualize colliders\n```\n\n### Crane-Specific Implementation\n\n**1. Brick Physics Setup**\n```javascript\n// Static ground\nconst ground = new THREE.Mesh(groundGeometry, material);\nground.userData.physics = { mass: 0 };\nphysics.addMesh(ground);\n\n// Dynamic bricks\nconst brick = new THREE.Mesh(boxGeometry, material);\nbrick.userData.physics = { mass: 1, restitution: 0.3 };\nphysics.addMesh(brick, 1, 0.3);\n```\n\n**2. Gripper Interaction**\n```javascript\n// Proximity detection (manual)\nconst distance = gripper.position.distanceTo(brick.position);\nif (distance < pickupThreshold) {\n  // Create fixed joint or parent constraint\n}\n```\n\n**3. Client-Server Synchronization**\n- Physics runs on frontend (for immediate feedback)\n- Send physics state to backend periodically\n- Backend validates and broadcasts authoritative state\n- Interpolate between states for smooth visuals\n\n### Best Practices\n\n**1. Initialization**\n- Rapier is async - must await initialization\n- Initialize before adding objects to scene\n\n**2. Performance**\n- Use simple collider shapes (box, sphere, capsule)\n- Enable CCD only for fast-moving objects\n- Batch physics updates when possible\n\n**3. Stability**\n- Set appropriate mass ratios (avoid 1000:1)\n- Use solver iterations for critical objects\n- Apply contact skin for stable stacking\n\n### Comparison with Alternatives\n\n**vs Ammo.js**:\n- ✅ Faster (WebAssembly vs asm.js)\n- ✅ Smaller bundle size\n- ✅ Cleaner API\n- ❌ Fewer features (no soft bodies, vehicles)\n\n**vs Cannon-es**:\n- ✅ Much faster performance\n- ✅ Better stability\n- ✅ Active development\n- ❌ Async initialization required\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n**1. Heightfield Support**\n```javascript\n// For terrain/ground variations\nphysics.addHeightfield(terrainMesh, width, depth, heightData, scale);\n```\n\n**2. Character Controllers**\n```javascript\n// Built-in character controller\nconst controller = physics.world.createCharacterController(offset);\ncontroller.setApplyImpulsesToDynamicBodies(true);\n```\n\n**3. Joints (for gripper attachment)**\n```javascript\n// Spherical joint example\nconst jointParams = physics.RAPIER.JointData.spherical(\n  anchorA, // On gripper\n  anchorB  // On brick\n);\nphysics.world.createImpulseJoint(jointParams, bodyA, bodyB);\n```\n\n### Recommendations for Crane Demo\n\n1. Use RapierPhysics from Three.js addons (already integrated)\n2. Run physics on frontend for responsive brick interactions\n3. Use simple box colliders for bricks\n4. Implement proximity-based pickup detection\n5. Use fixed joints for gripper attachment\n6. Enable CCD for dropped bricks to prevent tunneling\n7. Sync key physics events to backend (pickup, drop, collisions)\n</info added on 2025-07-11T23:15:33.555Z>",

Configure IK chain with proper joint constraints using THREE.IK's constraint system: Base Y-axis rotation, Arm rotation limits, and Lift Y-axis translation handling. 5. Update the inverse kinematics solver calls to use THREE.IK's solver methods instead of custom FABRIK calculations. 6. Ensure target position handling and constraint enforcement work correctly with the new library. 7. Test integration with existing CCDIKSolver fallback if needed, or fully migrate to THREE.IK for consistency. 8. Update any UI controls or input handling to work with the new IK system. 9. Optimize performance and ensure smooth real-time manipulation of crane position through x/y/z coordinates or 3D click interactions.",

Confirm inverse kinematics calculations produce stable and accurate results for various target positions. 4. Test joint constraint enforcement (base rotation limits, arm angle restrictions, lift translation bounds). 5. Verify smooth real-time crane manipulation through coordinate input and 3D click interactions. 6. Compare performance metrics between old FABRIK implementation and new THREE.IK system. 7. Test edge cases like unreachable positions and constraint violations. 8. Ensure WebSocket communication still works correctly with the new IK system. 9.
