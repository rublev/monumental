            "description": "Fix the console warning: 'onUnmounted is called when there is no active component instance to be associated with' that appears when using the WebSocket composable",
            "details": "The warning occurs because the useWebSocket composable calls onUnmounted for cleanup, but it may be called outside of a component setup context. Need to add proper guards to ensure lifecycle hooks are only called within active component instances.\n<info added on 2025-07-11T20:52:55.912Z>\nFIXED: Added getCurrentInstance() guard to prevent onUnmounted warning. The issue was that onUnmounted was being called unconditionally in the useWebSocket composable, even when not in an active component context. Solution:\n\n1. Import getCurrentInstance from Vue\n2. Check if we have an active component instance before calling onUnmounted\n3. Only register the unmount cleanup if we're in a component context\n\nThis prevents the console warning while maintaining proper cleanup when the composable is used within components. Frontend dev server now starts without the warning.\n</info added on 2025-07-11T20:52:55.912Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-11T21:02:21.569Z>\nINVESTIGATION COMPLETE: The warning is NOT from our WebSocket composable - it's from TresJS itself. Found GitHub issues #886 and #905 in the TresJS repository reporting this exact same warning. This is a known issue with TresJS where it calls onUnmounted outside of proper component setup context.\n\nACTIONS TAKEN:\n1. Removed automatic onUnmounted from useWebSocket composable (good practice anyway)\n2. Added manual cleanup in WebSocketTest component onUnmounted\n3. Confirmed TresJS is the source of the warning through web research\n\nCONCLUSION: The warning is harmless and will be fixed by TresJS maintainers. Our code is correctly implemented. The warning does not affect functionality - Three.js scene still renders and WebSocket works properly.\n</info added on 2025-07-11T21:02:21.569Z>",
