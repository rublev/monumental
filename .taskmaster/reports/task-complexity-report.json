			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Backend with uWebSockets.js",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the backend initialization into: project setup, uWebSockets.js installation and configuration, WebSocket endpoint implementation, connection handling, and server startup configuration",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward backend setup task with clear requirements. The complexity is moderate due to WebSocket configuration, but the steps are well-defined and sequential."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Vue3 Frontend with TypeScript and Core Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: Vue3 project scaffolding with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4.1 setup and configuration, TresJS installation for 3D graphics, Shadcn/vue component library setup, project structure organization, initial template cleanup, and dependency verification",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple technology integrations (Vue3, TypeScript, Tailwind v4.1, TresJS, Shadcn/vue). Each requires specific configuration steps and potential compatibility considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement WebSocket Client Connection",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: WebSocket composable creation with TypeScript, connection management implementation, reconnection logic, message handling system, state management for connection status, and UI integration with status display",
			"reasoning": "WebSocket client implementation requires careful state management, error handling, and reconnection logic. The TypeScript typing and Vue3 composable pattern add complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Three.js Scene with TresJS",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: TresJS component setup, camera and viewport configuration, lighting system implementation, 3D cube mesh creation, animation loop implementation, and scene integration into main app",
			"reasoning": "While 3D graphics can be complex, TresJS abstracts much of the Three.js complexity. The requirements are specific and achievable with clear steps."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Integration and Final Polish",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize into: WebSocket status UI component creation, comprehensive error handling implementation, code cleanup and optimization, and README documentation writing",
			"reasoning": "This is primarily a cleanup and documentation task with straightforward requirements. The main complexity is ensuring all components work together smoothly."
